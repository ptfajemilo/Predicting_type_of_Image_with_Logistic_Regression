# Predicting_type_of_Image_with_Logistic_Regression
The logistic regression was applied in the prediction of a number.
I imported various modules and packages needed for the modelling.
Total number of images and labels were determined.
Using sklearn.model_selection, train_test_split module was imported for splitting the data into training and testing dataset.
Logistic regression model was used in the prediction of the test dataset, followed by evaluation.
I used confusion matrix for plotting the prediction and heatmap for coloured display.
